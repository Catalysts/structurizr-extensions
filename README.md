# Structurizr Extensions

This project includes some tiny additions to [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/). Both of them can be used independently
or all together.

All libraries can be embedded with Maven or Gradle via JCenter.


## Structurizr for Spring Boot


The module `structurizr-spring-boot` contains Spring Boot `AutoConfiguration` to setup the code required to implement
a Structurizr Model. See [the project page](https://github.com/Catalysts/structurizr-extensions/tree/master/structurizr-spring-boot) for further details


## Structurizr for Kotlin

You love Kotlin? So do we! The library [the project page](https://github.com/Catalysts/structurizr-extensions/tree/master/structurizr-kotlin) provides
a tiny extension to create structurizr models in a fluent way
